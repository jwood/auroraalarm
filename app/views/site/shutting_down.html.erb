    <h2>Shutting Down</h2>
    <p>It saddens me to announce that AuroraAlarm will be shutting down effective immediately.</p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the SMS service that AuroaAlarm has been using for free has shut down.
      I would like to thank Signal for letting me use their service for free all of these years. Without them,
      AuroraAlarm would have never existed in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have debated switching over to a paid SMS service, but that would require that I charge all of you to use
      AuroraAlarm. I am not comfortable with that, because there are much better alternatives these days. Smartphones are
      everywhere now, and there are several great apps for doing what AuroraAlarm does. And, they work even better
      since you don't have to remember to tell a smartphone app when you are in a new zip code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to thank all of the AuroraAlarm users. It has been fun running this project. I really hope it helped
      some of you see the beautiful Northern Lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those interested, the AuroraAlarm application source code is, and always has been, available on GitHub
      at <a href="https://github.com/jwood/auroraalarm">https://github.com/jwood/auroraalarm</a>.

    <p><strong>Best of luck on your continued quest to view the Aurora!</strong></p>
